# PlanesAndShips
An OpenGL (at the moment) based game. This is a simple turn-based strategy game.

This is a 3D game implementation of a game I was playing as a kid back in the '80.
The short story of the game:

It's a two players turn based game
Each player have a a paper from a math notebook puting on the rows numbers and the columns letters.
Draw a few planes and ships on your paper...and try to guess what is on your oponent paper (resp. the location on the paper of his "army").
Each player can "shoot" against the other one by naming the target on the paper like "A3".
The idea of this is to make from such concept a 3D game that runs on the mobile phone (starting with Android at this moment).
